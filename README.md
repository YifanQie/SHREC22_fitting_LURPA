The files include:

1. load the point cloud from the SHREC22 track using main_SHREC22_dataprepare.m. The point clouds will be saved as images. (one-by-one for the purpose of checking)
2. load the all the 46000 point clouds from the SHREC22 track using DL_SHREC22_dataprepare.m and save them as images.
3.
